2. Binary Search Algorithm

This project identifies the implementation of the binary search algorithm, used to find an element in a sorted list. Binary search is efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).

3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

In this project it shows the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest path in a graph. It efficiently computes the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

4. Fibonacci Sequence

This project demonstrates the generation of the Fibonacci sequence using both iterative and recursive methods. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

5. Graph Traversal Algorithms

This project presents the implementation of two graph traversal algorithms: Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). These algorithms are used to explore nodes and edges of a graph.
