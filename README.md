1. Sorting Algorithms Comparison

This project demonstrates the implementation and comparison of three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The aim is to understand the functionality and performance differences between these algorithms.

2. Binary Search Algorithm

This project identifies the implementation of the binary search algorithm, used to find an element in a sorted list. Binary search is efficient with a time complexity of O(log n).

3. Dijkstra's Algorithm

In this project it shows the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is used for finding the shortest path in a graph. It efficiently computes the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

4. Fibonacci Sequence

This project demonstrates the generation of the Fibonacci sequence using both iterative and recursive methods. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

5. Graph Traversal Algorithms

This project presents the implementation of two graph traversal algorithms: Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). These algorithms are used to explore nodes and edges of a graph.
